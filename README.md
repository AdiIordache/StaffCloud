Run composer install.
Run php bin/console doctrine:database:create
Run php bin/console doctrine:schema:update
https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/installation.html I used npm
Use '/create-test-data' route to create some test data.

Valid to-do's:
Update the json path so it's dynamic.
Change the dependencies of objects so I save references to actual objects , not int's that need to be queried.

It took me about 12 hours to build this.
Out of the 12 probably more than 3-4 to build the actual database structure(Havent done it in years).
I am highly disapointed in my work(I was sure I could do better but haven't practiced building from the ground up).
